This repository consists of two alternative Generative Grasping CNNs (GG-CNN) using mixed autoencoders (AE), both improving performance. See [GG-CNN](https://github.com/dougsm/ggcnn) for detail on usage.

One mixed AE incorporates a dense AE, the other integrates [eForest](https://github.com/kingfengji/eForest) (random forest based AE) into the architecture.
