This repository consists of two alternative Generative Grasping CNNs (see [GG-CNN](https://github.com/dougsm/ggcnn) for details and usage) using mixed autoencoders (AE). 

One mixed AE incorporates a simple dense AE, the other integrates [eForest](https://github.com/kingfengji/eForest) (random forest based AE) into the architecture.
